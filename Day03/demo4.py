# Addition - Adding 2 or more varaiables, +
a = 5
b = 6
res = a+b
print(res) 
# 11

# Subtraction - Difference of 2 numbers, -
a = 10
b = 4
diff = a-b
print(diff)
# 6

print(7-12)
# -5

# Multiplication - Product of 2 or more numbers, *
x = 30
y = 5

print(x*y)
# 150


# Division - Quotient of 2 numbers, /
# Returns quotient in float datatype
a = 40
b = 2
print(a/b)
# 20.0
