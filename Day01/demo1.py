# High Level Programming language - Understood by humans
# Binary or Machine language - Language understood by computer. IT is 0s and 1s

# Translators - Which converts from HLL to ML
# Types of Translators
# 1. Compilers - Converts the entire block of code to ML. If there are any errors, it will give a warning or message after compilation, if not,
# it will convert code to ML
# 2. Interpreters - Reads the code line by line, if there are any errors, it will immediately give the message,
# else it will convert to ML

# WHat is a variable?
# Variable is a container or placeholder to hold a value

# Ex: a = 10
# Here 10 is assigned to variable a

a = 10
print(a)
# print() is an inbuilt function which gives the output in the console
