# Conditional Statements:
# In Python, condition statements act depending on whether a condition is True or False
# We can execute different blocks of code depending on the outcome of a condition

# There are 4 types of conditional statements
# if statement
# if else statement
# if elif else statement
# nested if else statements

# if statement in Python - simplest form
# It takes a condition and evaluates to True or False

# If the condition is True, then the True block of code will be executed, and if the condition is False, then the
# block of code is skipped and the control moves to the next line

# syntax of if statement
# if condition:
#     statement1
#     statement2
#     statementn

# outside if condition

# x = True
# if x == True:
#     print('Condition is True')
#
# print('Outside of if condition')

# Condition is True
# Outside of if condition


x = False
if x == True:
    print('Inside if condition')

print('Outside of if condition')

# Outside of if condition
