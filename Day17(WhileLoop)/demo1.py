# while loop - Iteration returns as long as the condition is True,
# once condition becomes False, iteration will stop

# syntax:
# while condition:
#   statements

# Infinite condition
# while True:
#     print('Inside while loop')
#
#
# print('Outside while loop')

# In simple words, The while loop enables the Python program to repeat a set of operations while a
# particular condition is true.
# When the condition becomes false, execution comes out of the loop immediately,
# and the first statement after the while loop is executed.

# Print numbers from 0 to 5 using while loop
i = 0
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i+1

print('Outside of while loop')

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5

print()
# Print numbers from 10 to 1 using while loop
i = 10
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i = i - 1
