# Membership operator(Relational): On iterables - list, tuple, set, dict

# There are 2 types : in and not in

list1 = ['Anuhya','Katyayanee','Bhushan','Seetha']

# in - Returns True if an item is a part of the iterable, else False
print('Rama' in list1)
# False

print('Anuhya' in list1)
# True

# not in - Returns True if an item is not part of the iterable, else False

print('Rama' not in list1)
# True

print('Anuhya' not in list1)
# False


# So the difference between is and ==
# is - checks if both objects referencing to the same location, Returns True if both objects are same

# == - returns True if both have same values
